# INSERTION SORT

* What is insertion sort? 
   
    * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

    * This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort.
