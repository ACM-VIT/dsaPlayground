# HEAPS

* What is a heap datastructure? 
   
    * Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

      1.Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same       property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. \
      2.Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same       property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
