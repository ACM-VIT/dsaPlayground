# dsaPlayground

This repo has been created to help each other in learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms.

* You should make full use of all the listed resources, descriptions and explore the subject yourself thoroughly.

* You can also implement the given topics in your choice of programming language and make a pull request. After review, we will push your codes here. This will help you practice, as well as help others learn from you.

* Do not hesitate to make additions of some good learning materials, programming contests, and other useful resources. 

* Also if you come across a new topic of interest as part of the course or competitive programming in general , you can ping us on group about the same , chances are that seniors already know about it and can help.

* New contributors refer [this](https://github.com/ACM-VIT/dsaPlayground/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
