This repo has been created to help each other in learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms.

You should make full use of all the listed resources, descriptions and explore the subject yourself thoroughly.

You can also implement the given topics in your choice of programming language and make a pull request. After review, we will push your codes here. This will help you practice, as well as help others learn from you.

Do not hesitate to make additions of some good learning materials, programming contests, and other useful resources. 

Also if you come across a new topic of interest as part of the course or competitive programming in general , you can ping us on group about the same , chances are that seniors already know about it and can help.

Happy Coding!</br>
